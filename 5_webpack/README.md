# Webpack

## Summary
Reads from an entry file and follows the dependency tree, pulling files into a large bundle as it travels. Webpack makes it possible to write code with any type of module pattern. 

## Interesting
- Removed the ordering problem by precompiling bundles all up front
- Asks browser to download one large javascript bundle rather than a series of smaller files like amd
- Efficient pecompilation allows developers to write js using the newest tools while we wait for javascript engines to catch up
